* Path needs to check original surface for min surface to avoid fp error.
* Move intersect scale safe method to vec and use it in prism.c
* Handle intersect scale error case in prism.  How do I set first and last?
* Convex Normalizations
- convexpolygon_project: requires minimum surface.
- convexpolygon_intersect: edge directions
* Path Normalizations
- estimate_refraction: requires minimum surface
- compute_reflection: requires minimum surface
- reverse_project: requires minimum surface
* Prism Divisions
- NormFromRel: Divide by length of first parameter.
- ComputeFull: Divide by distance to line.
- ComputeFull: Divide by prism->mSinThetaD
- ComputeFull: Fresnel equation computation.
- IntersectPrism: Surface dir + maxdir - mindir
- IntersectPrism: divide by s-surfacevec, n-minDir, x-maxDir
  (s/2 - n) - (s + x - n) * (s/2 - n).(s + x - n)
- create: Divide by light dir length.
* Check Culet calculation
* Test dimensions preserved in the cross section.
* Test dimension calculations.
